This program is principally intended to accompany the MAV Downlink Android Application.

It is the server-side code that allows the MAV Downlink application to connect to Mission Planner and similar applications.

This can also be used to pipe the I/O from any two clients that connect to ports 9999 and 9998 when this program is running, however.
